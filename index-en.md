# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy establishes the general policy for the handling of personal information for applications and Chrome extensions provided by KANI (hereinafter referred to as "we," "us," or "our").

If a separate privacy policy is established for a specific application or extension, the provisions of that individual privacy policy shall take precedence over this general policy.

In applications that perform individual-specific control for the purpose of improving application quality and providing information within the tool, personally identifiable information may be collected.

Browser extensions published on the Google Store operate as browser-based applications and may receive only the information necessary for their functionality.

Accordingly, applications that include such functions may collect personal information, and this Privacy Policy is established and published in accordance with Google's policies.

## Basic Policy

We recognize the importance of personal information and consider the protection of such information to be our social responsibility.  
We comply with applicable laws and regulations concerning personal information and appropriately acquire, use, and manage personal information handled by our applications.

## Scope of Application

This Privacy Policy applies to all applications and Chrome extensions developed and provided by us.  
The specific types of information collected vary depending on the functionality of each application.

This policy is effective as of September 1, 2024.

## Consent to the Handling of Personal Information

Before installing any application developed by us, users are requested to read this Privacy Policy carefully and use the application only if they agree to its terms.  
By installing the application, users are deemed to have agreed to this Privacy Policy.

## Purpose of Use of Personal Information

### Personalization

Our applications may provide content optimized for each individual user.  
In applications that include functionality requiring personal identification, information is collected only to the extent necessary to provide such functionality.  
Applications that do not require personally identifiable information will not collect such information.

### Improvement of Usability

For the purpose of providing optimized content according to user activity, information related to usage analysis may be collected. This may include individual operation history within our applications.

### User Support

When responding to user inquiries, support personnel may access operation history within the application as necessary.

## Management of Personal Information

### Accuracy of Information

Collected information includes personally identifiable information provided by users through input and authentication processes, and such information is treated as accurate on the premise that it has been provided correctly.  
If incorrect information is directly entered by the user, personalization may be performed based on such information.

### Security Management

Information collected by our applications is stored only to the extent necessary for operation on dedicated servers.  
These servers are maintained so that access is restricted to personnel involved in development and support.  
The security of information provided by other servers or services is ensured by the respective service providers.
